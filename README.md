# Shopping Cart React Application

This project is a simple shopping cart that i built using the React Library. I implemented four main components (Navbar, Counters, Counter) wrapped under their parent component (App), and used React to access methods within the parent component using props. 

**Please note that the Node Modules file was not included in this repository because it was too large**
